The Loan Approval Predictor is an interactive web application built using Streamlit for its user interface, providing users with a straightforward and engaging experience to predict loan eligibility. The backend of the application leverages multiple machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to generate predictions based on various user inputs.
->In addition to the web application, an in-depth analysis of the loan prediction dataset is performed in a Jupyter Notebook.
->This analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization of key patterns, and preprocessing steps like handling missing values and feature engineering.
->Different machine learning models are compared in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model for loan prediction.
