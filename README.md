# 📊 Loan Eligibility Prediction and Analysis using Machine Learning
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting loan eligibility based on user data using various machine learning algorithms. A dataset containing 600 rows of user financial and personal data has been thoroughly explored and preprocessed to build a robust predictive model for loan approval classification.

🔍 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist financial institutions in automating the loan approval process by accurately identifying whether a loan application is likely to be approved based on applicant information. The project involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 600 records

Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and numpy

Building and evaluating multiple machine learning models

Deploying the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation and preprocessing

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – to implement:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Streamlit – for creating a user-friendly web interface

🔬 Machine Learning Models
After preprocessing the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, etc.), three key models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression – to classify whether a user is eligible for a loan

Random Forest – for improved accuracy and handling complex patterns

Linear Regression – used for baseline comparison (though logistic is more suited for binary classification)

Each model's performance was measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best fit for real-world deployment.

🌐 Streamlit App
The final model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to input values and get real-time predictions on loan eligibility. This provides an intuitive and interactive experience for end users.

✅ Features
